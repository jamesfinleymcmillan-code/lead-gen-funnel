## Email 3: Value-Add + Tips
**Send**: 4 days after form submission
**Subject**: 3 mistakes that make business websites fail (and how to avoid them)

```
Hi [Name],

Quick question: Have you ever visited a business website that looked sketchy or unprofessional?

Probably made you question whether that business was legit, right?

Your potential customers feel the same way about YOUR website.

Here are the 3 biggest mistakes I see businesses make with their websites:

**Mistake #1: Slow loading speeds**
If your site takes more than 3 seconds to load, you're losing customers. That's why I build with Next.js - blazing fast performance out of the box.

**Mistake #2: Not mobile-friendly**
Over 60% of web traffic is mobile. If your site looks broken on phones, you're losing more than half your potential customers. All my sites are mobile-first by default.

**Mistake #3: No clear call-to-action**
Your website needs to tell visitors exactly what to do next. "Call us", "Book now", "Get a quote" - make it obvious and easy.

**Bonus tip for [Business Type] businesses:**
[Custom tip based on their business type - e.g., for e-commerce: "Include high-quality product photos and customer reviews to build trust and increase conversions"]

I've already sent you a custom quote for your project. If you're ready to get started, just reply to this email or book a quick call: [Calendly Link]

Still thinking it over? No pressure - take your time. I'm here when you're ready.

Cheers,
[Your Name]

P.S. Fun fact: The average DIY website built with Wix or Squarespace takes 3-4 weeks to complete. I can have a custom, professional site done in under a week. Just saying 😉

## Email 4: Final CTA + Urgency
**Send**: 7 days after form submission
**Subject**: Your website quote expires soon - [Name]

```
Hey [Name],

I wanted to follow up one last time about your website project.

I sent over your custom quote last week with pricing for [Budget Range] and a timeline to get your site live.

Here's the thing: I keep my prices low by limiting how many projects I take on at once. Right now I have 1 spot open for this month, but I'm getting close to capacity.

**If you book by [Date - 3 days from now], I can:**
✓ Lock in the price from your quote (no surprise costs)
✓ Start working on your site this week
✓ Have your site live within 3-5 days
✓ Include free revisions to get it exactly right

**After [Date], my next available spot is [Next Month]** - and prices may increase based on my workload.

I totally understand if the timing isn't right or you're going a different direction. No hard feelings at all.

But if you're still interested in getting a professional website that actually brings you customers, let's make it happen.

Reply to this email or book a free call here: [Calendly Link]

Either way, I wish you the best with your [Business Type] business!

All the best,
[Your Name]

P.S. Not ready yet? No worries. Save my email for when you are - I'd love to work together in the future.
```

## How to Set Up in Mailchimp

### Step 1: Create a Mailchimp Account
1. Go to mailchimp.com and sign up for free (up to 500 contacts)
2. Create a new audience for your leads

### Step 2: Connect Google Sheets to Mailchimp
1. Use Zapier (free tier) to connect your Google Sheets to Mailchimp
2. Set up a Zap: "When new row is added to Google Sheets → Add subscriber to Mailchimp"
3. Map the fields: Name, Email, Phone, Business Type, Budget

### Step 3: Create Email Automation
1. In Mailchimp, go to Automations → Create → Custom
2. Set trigger: "When subscriber is added to audience"
3. Add 4 emails with the templates above
4. Set delays: Email 1 (immediate), Email 2 (+2 days), Email 3 (+4 days), Email 4 (+7 days)

### Step 4: Personalize
Replace these placeholders in each email:
- `[Name]` - Subscriber's first name
- `[Business Type]` - From their form submission
- `[Budget Range]` - From their form submission
- `[Your Name]` - Your actual name
- `[Calendly Link]` - Your actual Calendly booking link
- `[Date]` - Use Mailchimp's date merge tags

### Pro Tips
- Test the sequence by adding yourself as a test subscriber
- Track open rates and click rates in Mailchimp dashboard
- A/B test subject lines to improve open rates
- Personalize Email 3's bonus tip based on business type
- Update Email 4's urgency dates monthly to keep it current

---

## Alternative: Manual Email Sequence

If you prefer not to use Mailchimp initially, you can:
1. Check your Google Sheets daily for new submissions
2. Copy/paste these templates into Gmail
3. Manually customize and send based on the schedule
4. Set calendar reminders for follow-ups

This works fine when starting out (under 10 leads/week), but automation saves significant time as you scale.
