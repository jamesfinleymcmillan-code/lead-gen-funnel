- Double budget on best performer

**Week 3-4:** Optimize winning ad
- Test different audiences
- Test different images
- Increase budget to $30/day if ROI is positive

## Success Metrics

**Track These:**
- Cost Per Click (CPC): Target under $0.50
- Click-Through Rate (CTR): Target above 2%
- Cost Per InitiateCheckout: Target under $20
- Cost Per Purchase: Target under $200

**If after $100 spent:**
- No sales = pause, fix landing page or offer
- 1+ sales = keep going, increase budget

## Free Traffic Tactics (While Running Ads)

### 1. Local Business Groups
- Join Facebook groups for local businesses
- Answer questions, offer value
- Mention your service when relevant
- Don't spam - be genuinely helpful

### 2. LinkedIn Outreach (Free)
- Connect with 20 local business owners per day
- Send personalized message:
  "Hey [Name], I help [industry] businesses get more customers through professional websites. Would love to connect!"

### 3. Cold Email (Free)
- Find businesses with bad websites
- Email: "Hi [Name], I noticed [specific issue with their site]. I specialize in building websites for [industry]. Would you be open to a quick chat about improving your online presence?"

### 4. Partner with the Cold Caller
- Give him this landing page URL
- Track manually by asking customers "how did you hear about us?"
- Pay him 10-20% per sale

### 5. Reddit/Forums
- r/smallbusiness
- r/entrepreneur
- Answer questions about websites
- Link to your site in profile

## Quick Wins

1. **Retargeting Pixel**: Everyone who visits your site will be tracked. In 2 weeks, create a retargeting campaign showing ads to people who visited but didn't buy. These convert at 5-10x higher rates.

2. **Lookalike Audiences**: After 10 purchases, create a "lookalike audience" in Facebook - it will find people similar to your customers.

3. **Testimonials**: Get testimonials from first 3 customers, add to ads immediately.
